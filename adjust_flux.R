# CHECK # consider making albedo a function of compass direction (sea reflects more, so 1 for W another for E); perhaps consider wind also (no wind, more reflection); this only matters for reflected radiation

# timestamps
# CHECK UTC vs LOCAL verificar

# sun vector
# UTC is 0
# if hell breaks loose, check if timezone should be 0 or local
